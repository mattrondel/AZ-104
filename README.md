    "MS Learn was extremely lackluster." "for the love of God, dont rely only on MS Learn."
    
    Github labs: https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/

    "The user management questions are always worded so poorly, and some of the scenarios they present are so...hypothetical."

    TD tutorials dojo practice exams are very similar to the real one

üöß ***Study tips:*** üöß

Do like 1-2 hrs per day going through modules and the last few weeks before before sceduled exam go through practice exams. 
The practice exams will help identify your weak areas for you to do further studying on. Try not to burn out yourself while studying and remember to take breaks.
