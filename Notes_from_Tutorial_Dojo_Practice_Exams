With Azure Backup service, you can back up on-premises machines, workloads, and Azure VMs. If you would recall, the VM in a stopped/deallocated state only stops the virtual machine. Take note that Azure Backup only takes snapshots of the VM disks. This means that even if the VM status is running or stopped, you can still create a backup as long as the disk is attached to the VM.

Network Watcher Agent VM extension enables packet capture functionality, which is crucial for diagnosing complex network problems.

The Custom Script Extension downloads and executes scripts on Azure virtual machines. This extension is useful for post-deployment configuration, software installation, or any other configuration or management tasks.

Hence, the correct order of deployment are:

1. Deploy the Azure File Sync agent to TDFileServer1

2. Register TDFileServer1 with Storage Sync Service

3. Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint

4. Create a server endpoint

Azure Private DNS

Take note that you can only link a virtual network and use the auto registration feature to 
a private DNS zone only.

When recovering files, you can’t restore files to a previous or future operating system version. 
For example, you can’t restore a file from a Windows Server 2016 VM to Windows Server 2012 or a Windows 8 computer. 
You can restore files from a VM to the same server operating system, or to the compatible client operating system.

You can’t delete a Recovery Services vault with any of the following dependencies:
– You can’t delete a vault that contains protected data sources.
– You can’t delete a vault that contains backup data. Once backup data is deleted, it will go into the soft-deleted state.
– You can’t delete a vault that contains backup data in the soft-deleted state.
– You can’t delete a vault that has registered storage accounts.

To retrieve data in the Log Analytics workspace, you need to use a Kusto Query Language (KQL). Remember that there are different types of log queries in Azure Monitor
With search queries, you can find the specific value that you need in your table. This query searches the “TableName” table for records that contains the word “value”:
search in (TableName) "value"

Implement and Manage Storage

Take note that Azure does not overwrite any files in your sync group. Instead, it will keep both changes to files that are changed in two endpoints 
at the same time. The most recently written change keeps the original file name.

The older file (determined by LastWriteTime) has the endpoint name and the conflict number appended to the filename. 
For server endpoints, the endpoint name is the name of the server. For cloud endpoints, the endpoint name follows this taxonomy

– <FileNameWithoutExtension>-<endpointName>[-#].<ext>

– For example, tutorials-FileServer1.docx


Azure File Sync supports 100 conflict files per file. Once the maximum number of conflict files has been reached, the file will fail to sync until the number of conflict files is less than 100.

Manage Azure Identities and Governance

By default, global administrators in Microsoft Entra and device owners are granted local administrator rights. 
This configuration is a premium edition capability, and it is available through products such as Microsoft EntraPremium or the Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS).
Configure device settings is how you would configure this feature

Deploy and Manage Azure Compute Resources

You can export the template of an existing virtual machine and save it in Azure Resource Manager. The exported template is composed of parameters and template JSON files.
In custom deployment the only options that you can configure are Subscription, Resource Group, and Location.

Azure Custom Script Extension - You can use Custom Script Extension to download and execute scripts on Azure VMs. This extension is useful for post-deployment configuration, software installation, or any other configuration/management task. 
Scripts can be downloaded from Azure storage or GitHub, or provided to the Azure portal at extension run-time.

Web Server Logging in Azure App Service log message includes data such as the HTTP method, resource URI, client IP, client port, user agent, response code, and so on. 

For web server logging, you can store the logs in a storage or file system and set the number of days the logs should be retained.

Azure Load Balancer is a Layer-4 (TCP, UDP) load balancer that provides high availability by distributing incoming traffic among healthy VMs. 
To redirect the client request to the same virtual machine, you need to add a session persistence in the load balancing rule. Session persistence specifies that traffic from a client should be handled by the same virtual machine in the backend pool for the duration of a session.
There are three options in session persistence:
– None – specifies that successive requests from the same client may be handled by any virtual machine.
– Client IP – specifies that the same virtual machine will handle successive requests from the same client IP address.
– Client IP and protocol – specifies that the same virtual machine will handle successive requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination

Scaling up a virtual machine will increase its size in response to a workload. this is a preferred option if an application has tightly-coupled dependencies and thus cannot be hosted on multiple virtual machines.
